# Overview
An implementation of GPU ray tracing on NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti. The origin CPU code is in Peter Shirley's 
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
Same image in the CPU version takes about 1559.08 seconds to render and the GPU version takes about 89.65 seconds. 
It results in a 17.4x speed up. And the optimized version further results in a 2.64x speed up.
